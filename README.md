<h1 align="center">Brazilian Highways - API</h1>

## Why?

The main motivation that originated this work comes from the fact that today there is a need for mapping sections of Brazilian highways with a focus on kilometers markings, concession information and emergency contacts numbers. 
We recognize that part of the problems mentioned are already solved in other tools, however not a place where the functionalities are grouped in a single API available publicly.

## Project

An API based entirely on the Vercel platform, with data structured at build time, promoting a distributed solution.
As mentioned above, for the implementation to be possible, the data is coupled to the application directory through JSON files and the mapping of highways is done through an internal interface that is available at development time.
